		SAP offers a lot of job opportunities. There are two basic classification of modules in SAP. Some SAP technical modules:<br><br>
		
		
		• SAP Basis<br>
		• SAP Security<br>
 		• Advanced Business Application Programming (SAP ABAP)<br>
 		• High Performance Analytic Appliance (SAP HANA)<br><br>
Some SAP functional modules:<br><br>
 • Human Resource Management (SAP HRM), also known as Human Resource (HR)<br>
 • Production Planning (SAP PP)<br>
 • Material Management (SAP MM)<br>
 • Financial Supply Chain Management (SAP FSCM)<br>
 • Sales and Distribution (SAP SD)<br><br>
Whatever, you can become a functional consultant or technical consultant, another most important
thing to fetch a SAP job in German speaking countries is your GERMAN language skill. Since the origin of
SAP is Germany and it has become one of the most valuable German brands, please be mindful of
learning basic German. You are dealing with a globally recognized German ERP software; here your
German communication skills and your SAP knowledge will ease your entry into Germany.<br><br>
It would be great if you could determine the German and English meanings of Tcodes (transaction
codes) expansions, abbreviations, accountancy terms in SAP. That is the primary reason, we have
developed this glossary. Hold on ...it does not mean that other languages have no business here. SAP is
operated in all the major global lingua franca.<br><br>
Soon you will find other language glossaries (such as Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, French, Portuguese,
Italian, Polish) for SAP terms in this website.<br><br>
Have fun with it!<br><br>
