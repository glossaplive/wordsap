		<h3 style="color:#0083FF">About the name:</h3>
		<p class="questdesc">In German the word Glossar means "glossary". This website is built for SAP
			terminologies translation in the language pair German and English. So Glossar (German: glossary) is
			suitably named "glossap" - a glossary for SAP terminologies translation.
		</p>
		
		<h3 style="color:#0083FF">Who we are</h3>
		<p class="questdesc">We use SAP Software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_SE" target="_blank">(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_SE)</a> for projects from our German clients. We
		maintain a big repository of SAP translations. Unlike generic computer terms, SAP German-English
		terminology is different. It is not what one normally thinks of. For example, document parking is a very
		specific term in SAP, which in SAP technically means temporarily saving the data. Here we can neither
		say "saving the document" nor "pre-creation of document". Once you are familiar with the SAP tool, you
		would have to say "parking" instead of "temporarily storing" or "pre-creation". Coming to German
		translation, to park generally means "parken" in German language, which is wrong if you use this in SAP
		works. It should be: vorerfassen.
		
		<br><br>
		<span style="color:#0083FF">Another example:</span> The German word <span style="color:green">"Preishistorie"</span> normally means <span style="color:tomato">"price history"</span> in English. But in
		SAP it is called <span style="color:#0083FF">"cost change history".</span> Though you have basic German knowledge, SAP terminologies are
		different from standard German. You've seen one, you've seen them all ! You can rely on this website,
		to avoid wasting time in searching for the exact SAP meaning.
		</p>
		
		<h3 style="color:#0083FF">What do we provide here?</h3>
		<p class="questdesc">1) All SAP related German-English translations (error messages, menus, screens, fields, etc)
		<br>2) A quiz for those who want to test their basic German knowledge.
		<br>3) Basic insight on SAP
		
		<span style="color:tomato">Attention: </span>Some words, which cannot be found in SAP term search website, can be found in our web
		site. Wanna try? You can search for the English meaning of the German word " " in SAP context. You will
		be sick and tired of searching. Finally, you can find it here.
		</p>
		
		<h3 style="color:#0083FF">How does it work?</h3>
		<p class="questdesc">Once you search a term, if the search word is found in our database, it will be fetched and displayed.
Else, our team will help you find your search request at the earliest.<br><br>
If you find any error (spelling, gender classification or any other discrepancy), please send it with proof
(screenshot) to us. If it is valid you will be rewarded.
