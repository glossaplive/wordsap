We will help you get the exact word. <span style="color:#004FFF">We use licensed SAP application</span> that covers FICO, PLM, Basis, SD, SCM, PP, BI, ABAP BO and many other modules. So, we know, what to be searched in which module.
<br><br>We analyze the searched word very carefully, search and compare in many modules and based on our extensive experience as SAP consultants, we find the exact German-English and/or English-German word, which the user needs. Obviously, some search words have other meanings as well. We will have added the “context-dependent” tag to those words in brackets. Only the user, who searched the word, needs to decide, which one he or she picks out.
