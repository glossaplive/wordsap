		SAP stands for <b>"System Applications and Products in Data Processing"</b>. The company’s original German
			name is <b>"Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung"</b>, which means System Analysis Program Development in
English.<br><br>
SAP is the leading ERP software, which helps companies across all the industries perform their day-to-
day business transactions efficiently.<br><br>
These industries include: Logistics, Production, Retail, Marketing, Maintenance, Finance, Shipment,
Banking, Insurance, Telecommunication, Human Resources, Health sector etc. It does not matter, what
the company size is. You can still think of SAP implementation for your business based on your
requirement and budget. All your business transactions and requirements can be managed efficiently
using SAP.<br><br>
Some modules in which you can think of that SAP is effectively implemented:<br>
</p>

		<p class="questdesc">
		
		<span style="color:blue">PP: Production planning</span> - Planning is the key factor for every successful business. When you get a
business order from a customer, you need to plan how you are going to meet the requirements. For
example, you are a vendor (supplier) who can supply a material, say 50,000 water bottle lids to your
customer. Now your customer needs around 10, 000,00 lids from you - a bulk order. You should plan for
mass production from your side. Here SAP as ERP software can help you make things easier and in an
orderly fashion.<br><br>
<span style="color:blue">MM: Materials Management (Materialwissenschaft)</span> - To run a company, you need some materials,
unless it is purely a virtual company. Those materials need to be managed properly. For example, you
are running a hotel business across top cities in your country. Materials required for this business must
be monitored in advance before it hits a stock zero. Here SAP as ERP software deals with how the
process works from procurement to payment, from inventory through final invoice receipt and
verification.<br><br>
<span style="color:blue">SD: Sales and Distribution</span> - The most important module. Business needs a sale, and every business
wants a sound sale. For example, you are running a textile industry. You should be aware of the sales
figures at any time. What was the sales data last year and what is to be achieved this year as sales
target? Do I need more sales points? Here SAP as ERP software can efficiently respond to your business
concerns with its reports (SAP Business Objects). From purchase order, invoice processing, sales order,
releasing the billing document and other related things can be handled together in this single module.<br><br>
<span style="color:blue">FICO</span> - Financial support is inevitable for a business. It varies in the form of investments from investors or
your own capital or bank loans etc. Now you got a huge amount of money in hand and You have setup
your company too. Now you need to manage the money which is also called "Financial Management".
Financial analysis and forecast are the vital determining factors of a best-run business. With SAP as ERP
you can drive your financial tasks the way you wish.<br><br>
<span style="color:blue">HR / HCM</span> - Human Capital Management: Manpower is one of the greatest deciding factors of a
successful business. It may be any sort of business say small-scale, medium-scale or business on a large
scale. The success of a business mainly depends upon the manpower. For example, you have supply
chain business and have hired many direct and indirect employees. All employee related things such as
attendance, time recording, working hours, payment, incentives, overtime, internal conflicts among
employees and leaves must be maintained in proper shape. SAP HR HCM is yet another efficient ERP for
these things.<br><br>
