What is a privacy policy? <br>

One of the major responsibilities of a service provider to keep user's data secure. The service provider must ensure that the users' data are always secure. At the same time, the service provider can study the users' data who use the services, so that service provider can understand users' needs. The study includes: from which location the page is visited, what is frequently searched in the website, what is not rendered back to the user, how long user stays at the site etc. Based on these data service provider can improve the site and add valuable contents to the site. The service provider is entitled to make promotions (advertisments and publishments) on his site based on the study.  

Service provider must mention how he can maintain the users' data and what he will not commit with the users' data. Simply the dos and don'ts with the user data. This is called privacy policy. Privacy policy may vary from country to country. But the objective is to keep users' data secure.
